# secure-electron-template
A current electron app template with the most popular frameworks, designed and built with security in mind. (If you are curious about what makes an electron app secure, please check out [this page](https://github.com/reZach/secure-electron-template/blob/master/docs/secureapps.md)).

## Roadmap
There are a number of additions that I'd like to implement in this repository, namely more release-focused enhancements and test suites, but those are lower priority (but I welcome PRs!).

## Architecture
For a more detailed view of the architecture of the template, please check out [here](https://github.com/reZach/secure-electron-template/blob/master/docs/architecture.md). I would _highly_ recommend reading this document to get yourself familiarized with this template.

## How to get started
To get started, clone the repository by clicking the ![Use this template](https://github.com/reZach/secure-electron-template/blob/master/docs/imgs/usethistemplate.png "Use this template") button, or through the command line (`git clone https://github.com/reZach/secure-electron-template.git`). 

Once cloned, install the dependencies for the repo by running the following commands (you do _not_ have to run the first command if your command line is already inside the newly cloned respository):

```
cd secure-electron-template
npm i
npm run dev
```
